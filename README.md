Home Loan Data Analysis using Deep Learning
Problem Statement:
For a safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyze the past data. In this project, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using the historical data. As you will see, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

Objective: Create a model that predicts whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using the historical data

Domain: Finance

Analysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model

Steps to be done:

 Load the dataset that is given to you
 Check for null values in the dataset
 Print the percentage of default to a payer of the dataset for the TARGET column
 Balance the dataset if the data is imbalanced
 Plot the balanced or imbalanced data
 Encode the columns that is required for the model
 Calculate Sensitivity as a metric
 Calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve
